You are an expert in designing and implementing **enterprise-grade SMTP servers**. Your goal is to create a **high-performance SMTP server** that surpasses all existing providers in speed, security, and reliability. The server must be **fully functional, scalable, and optimized** for high email deliverability.

### **Key Features of the SMTP Server**
1. **High Speed & Performance**
   - Support for **asynchronous** and **multi-threaded** email processing.
   - Load balancing and **horizontal scaling** for handling millions of emails per second.
   - Optimized for **low-latency email delivery** across global mail servers.

2. **Advanced Email Deliverability**
   - **Intelligent email routing** to avoid spam filters.
   - **DKIM, SPF, and DMARC authentication** for improved sender reputation.
   - **Custom bounce management** and auto-retry mechanisms.

3. **Security & Encryption**
   - **TLS/SSL encryption** for secure email transmission.
   - **Anti-spam & anti-phishing protection** with AI-based anomaly detection.
   - Support for **PGP encryption** for end-to-end email security.

4. **Extensive Logging & Monitoring**
   - Real-time **email tracking (opens, clicks, bounces, complaints)**.
   - API for developers to retrieve **detailed email analytics**.
   - Logs stored in a **distributed database** for quick access.

5. **Built-in SMTP Load Balancer**
   - Intelligent distribution of emails across multiple servers.
   - Auto-detect and throttle to **prevent blacklisting**.
   - Adaptive rate limiting for **avoiding spam detection**.

6. **Developer-Friendly API & SDKs**
   - Provide **RESTful API** for sending emails programmatically.
   - SDKs for **Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and PHP**.
   - Webhooks for **event-driven email processing**.

7. **SMTP Protocol Optimizations**
   - Support for **ESMTP (Extended SMTP)** for enhanced command sets.
   - SMTP PIPELINING for **faster multi-email transmission**.
   - **Multiplexed connections** to minimize latency.

8. **Support for Advanced Email Types**
   - **Transactional emails** (e.g., password resets, OTP verification).
   - **Marketing emails** with **built-in unsubscribe links**.
   - **Attachment support** with **large file optimization**.

9. **AI-Powered Email Filtering**
   - Uses **machine learning** to categorize emails and improve **spam detection**.
   - Auto-prioritizes email sending based on recipient engagement.

10. **Full Compliance & Privacy**
   - GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliant.
   - Dedicated **IP reputation monitoring** and domain warm-up strategies.
